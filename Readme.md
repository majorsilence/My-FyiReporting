# Introduction
"FYIReporting Designer is a report and charting system based on Microsoft's Report Definition Language (RDL). 
Tabular, free form, matrix, charts are fully supported. HTML, PDF, XML, .Net Control, and printing supported. 
A WYSIWYG designer allows you to create reports without knowledge of RDL. Wizards are available for creating new 
reports and for inserting new tables, matrixes, and charts into existing reports." (http://www.fyireporting.com/)

Use the report viewer .NET controls from ASP.NET, WPF, or Winforms using C#, F#, VB.NET, IronPython, or any 
other .NET language.  The winform viewer also works in linux using mono.  An experimental Gtk/WPF/Cocoa viewer also exists. 

Majorsilence Reporting started as My-FyiReporting which was a fork of fyiReporting after it died. It has been rebranded as Majorsilence Reporting to make it clearer that it is a separate forked project.  Majorsilence Reporting is a fork of fyiReporting.  I cannot stress this enough.  This is a FORK.
The main purpose is to make sure that I have a copy of fyiReporting since that project seems to be dead.  I am leaving the
github project named My-FyiReporting so links are not broken.  All branding will eventually be replaced with Majorsilence Reporting.

Also check this [projects wiki](https://github.com/majorsilence/My-FyiReporting/wiki) as information will be slowly added.

Majorsilence Reporting is currently built with visual studio 2010 and 2012 and targets .net 4.0.  You can also run the build script in 
the Release-Builds folder to build .net 3.5 (may be broken) and 4.0 packages.  

# Development
Majorsilence Reporting is developed with the following workflow:

* Nothing happens for weeks
* Someone needs it to do something it doesn't already do
* That person implements that something and submits a pull request
* Repeat
If it doesn't have a feature that you want it to have, add it.  If it has a bug you need fixed, fix it.

## Contribute:
All contributions welcome.  I'll try to respond the same day to any emails or pull requests.  Or within a few 
days at the most.  Small pull requests are best as they are easier to review.

 RDL Compliance
Report file format specifications can be obtained from microsoft.  I believe fyiReporting is currently mostly 
compatible with RDL 2005.  If you want to add more features see the specfications.

* RDL specifications: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297486%28v=sql.100%29.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297486%28v=sql.100%29.aspx)

#User interface tutorials:
ReportingCloud (another fork) has made some tutorials for using the designer and creating reports. 
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/reportingcloud/files/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/reportingcloud/files/)

I know there are other forks but last I checked they also seemed to be dead.  The main fyiReporting site is 
found at http://www.fyireporting.com/ and it has examples found at [http://www.fyireporting.com/helpv4/index.php](http://www.fyireporting.com/helpv4/index.php) and 
the forum is [http://www.fyireporting.com/forum/index.php](http://www.fyireporting.com/forum/index.php).  However has I said above for the most part it is a dead 
project.

UPDATE: ReportFU [http://reportfu.org](http://reportfu.org) ~~is alive?~~ is dead (2019-01-18)

UPDATE: NReport [http://nreports.codeplex.com/](http://nreports.codeplex.com/) - Looks dead.
